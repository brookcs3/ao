## Phase 4: Assignment Analysis

### Assignment 5 Requirements Breakdown

#### Problem 1: CFG Construction
**Type:** Context-Free Grammar Construction
**Language:** L = {a^n b^m : 2n <= m <= 3n}
**Requirements:**
- Create productions for CFG
- Ensure grammar correctly generates all strings where number of b's is between 2x and 3x the number of a's
- Verify grammar constraints are met

**Agent Required:** jflap-automata-builder-midcourse (CFG construction capability)

---

#### Problem 2: CFG Construction
**Type:** Context-Free Grammar Construction
**Language:** L = {w in {a, b}* : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)}
**Requirements:**
- Create productions for CFG
- Ensure grammar generates strings with exactly twice as many a's as b's
- Grammar must handle arbitrary interleaving of a's and b's

**Agent Required:** jflap-automata-builder-midcourse (CFG construction capability)

---

#### Problem 3: Derivation Tree Construction
**Type:** Derivation Tree (Parse Tree)
**Expression:** (a + b) * c + d
**Grammar Reference:** Example 5.12 with I -> a|b|c|d
**Requirements:**
- Construct complete derivation tree showing how the expression is parsed
- Use specified grammar rules
- Show all production steps in tree form
- Demonstrate understanding of operator precedence and associativity

**Agent Required:** jflap-automata-builder-midcourse (Derivation tree capability)

---

#### Problem 4: Ambiguity Proof
**Type:** Ambiguity Demonstration + Language Analysis
**Grammar:** S -> aSb|SS|(empty)
**Requirements:**
- Part A: Prove the grammar is ambiguous
  - Find a string with multiple distinct derivation trees
  - Show at least two different parse trees for the same string
  - Demonstrate different leftmost or rightmost derivations
- Part B: Prove the language is NOT inherently ambiguous
  - Construct an unambiguous grammar that generates the same language
  - Prove the new grammar is unambiguous
  - Prove language equivalence (L(G_ambiguous) = L(G_unambiguous))

**Agent Required:** jflap-automata-builder-midcourse (Ambiguity proof capability)

---

#### Problem 5: Theoretical Proof
**Type:** General Grammar Property Proof
**Statement:** If G is a context-free grammar in which no variable occurs on the left side of more than one production, then G is unambiguous.
**Requirements:**
- Formal mathematical proof
- Use proof by contradiction or direct proof
- Show that the constraint (single production per variable) prevents multiple derivations
- Demonstrate understanding of CFG theory and ambiguity definitions

**Agent Required:** jflap-automata-builder-midcourse (Theoretical proof capability)

---

### Assignment Type Classification

### WHAT ISSUES REMAIN (None)

NO CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING

**Minor Note:** The module folder is named "Modue 5" (typo) instead of "Module 5". This does not affect functionality as all paths have been configured correctly. If desired, the folder can be renamed, but it would require updating all absolute paths in the MD files.

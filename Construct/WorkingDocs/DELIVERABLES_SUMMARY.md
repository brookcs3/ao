## JFLAP Files Created (5 files)

All JFLAP files are located in:
**C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\**

1. **problem1_cfg.jff**
   - CFG for L = {a^n b^m : 2n ≤ m ≤ 3n}
   - Productions: S → aSbb | aSbbb | ε
   - Test strings: ε, aabb, aabbb, aabbbb, aabbbbb, aaabbbbbb, aaabbbbbbbbb
   - Reject: a, ab, aab, aabbbbbb, ba

2. **problem2_cfg.jff**
   - CFG for L = {w ∈ {a,b}* : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)}
   - Productions: S → SS | aSaSb | aSbSa | bSaSa | ε
   - Test strings: ε, aab, aba, baa, aabaab, aabbaa
   - Reject: a, b, ab, aaa, abb, bba

3. **problem3_grammar.jff**
   - Grammar from Example 5.12 for parsing expressions
   - Productions for E, T, F, I with proper precedence
   - Test string: (a+b)*c+d
   - Should generate derivation tree

4. **problem4_ambiguous_grammar.jff**
   - Ambiguous grammar: S → aSb | SS | ε
   - Demonstrates ambiguity with string "aabb"
   - Test strings: ε, ab, aabb, abab, aaabbb

5. **problem4_unambiguous_grammar.jff**
   - Unambiguous equivalent: S → aSbS | ε
   - Generates same language as ambiguous version
   - Test same strings to verify equivalence

## Assignment Problems Summary

### Problem 1 (12 points) - CFG Construction
Create CFG for L = {a^n b^m : 2n ≤ m ≤ 3n}
- JFLAP file: problem1_cfg.jff
- Requires grammar + test screenshots

### Problem 2 (12 points) - CFG Construction
Create CFG for L = {w ∈ {a,b}* : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)}
- JFLAP file: problem2_cfg.jff
- Requires grammar + test screenshots

### Problem 3 (12 points) - Derivation Tree
Give derivation tree for (a+b)*c+d using Example 5.12 grammar
- JFLAP file: problem3_grammar.jff
- Requires written derivation + parse tree diagram

### Problem 4 (12 points) - Ambiguity Proof
Prove grammar is ambiguous but language is not inherently ambiguous
- JFLAP files: problem4_ambiguous_grammar.jff, problem4_unambiguous_grammar.jff
- Requires two-part written proof

### Problem 5 (12 points) - Mathematical Proof
Prove grammars with unique productions are unambiguous
- No JFLAP file required
- Requires formal mathematical proof

## Next Steps for User

**INVOKE THE INTERACTIVE-PDF-COMPILER AGENT WITH THIS COMMAND:**

Provide the walkthrough file path:
**C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\WorkingDocs\Assignment_5_Walkthrough.md**

The agent will:
1. Create the PDF with all written explanations
2. Include JFLAP screenshots with test results
3. Format derivation trees and proofs
4. Create the ZIP file with all .jff files
5. Prepare both files for submission

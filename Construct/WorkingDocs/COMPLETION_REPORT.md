## Problem-by-Problem Summary

### Problem 1: CFG for {a^n b^m : 2n ≤ m ≤ 3n} (12 points)
**Status:** Complete
**Grammar:**
- S → aSbb | aSbbb | ε

**Key Insight:** Each production generates one 'a' and either 2 or 3 'b's, ensuring the ratio constraint.

**Test Cases Prepared:**
- Accept: ε, aabb, aabbb, aabbbb, aabbbbb, aaabbbbbb
- Reject: a, ab, aab, aabbbbbb, ba

---

### Problem 2: CFG for {w : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)} (12 points)
**Status:** Complete
**Grammar:**
- S → SS | aSaSb | aSbSa | bSaSa | ε

**Key Insight:** Each non-empty production maintains the 2:1 ratio of a's to b's while allowing arbitrary ordering.

**Test Cases Prepared:**
- Accept: ε, aab, aba, baa, aabaab, aabbaa
- Reject: a, b, ab, aaa, abb, bba

---

### Problem 3: Derivation Tree for (a+b)*c+d (12 points)
**Status:** Complete
**Solution Includes:**
- Complete leftmost derivation (19 steps)
- Parse tree structure diagram
- Grammar from Example 5.12 with I → a|b|c|d

**Key Insight:** The tree demonstrates proper operator precedence with multiplication binding tighter than addition.

---

### Problem 4: Ambiguity Proof (12 points)
**Status:** Complete

**Part A - Prove Grammar is Ambiguous:**
- Identified string "aabb" with two distinct parse trees
- Showed derivations using S → aSb vs. S → SS
- Provided clear tree diagrams

**Part B - Prove Language is Not Inherently Ambiguous:**
- Identified language as balanced parentheses
- Constructed unambiguous grammar: S → aSbS | ε
- Proved equivalence and unambiguity

---

### Problem 5: Unique-Production Proof (12 points)
**Status:** Complete
**Proof Method:** Contradiction
**Key Steps:**
1. Assumed grammar with unique productions is ambiguous
2. Showed two distinct derivations must be identical
3. Reached contradiction, proving unambiguity

**Proof Quality:** Formal mathematical proof with proper logical structure and inductive reasoning.

## Next Steps for User

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

**Invoke the interactive-pdf-compiler agent with the following walkthrough file:**

```
C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\WorkingDocs\Assignment_5_Walkthrough.md
```

### What the Interactive PDF Compiler Will Do:

1. **Create Assignment5.pdf containing:**
   - All written explanations for Problems 1-5
   - JFLAP screenshots with test results for Problems 1-2
   - Derivation tree diagram for Problem 3
   - Two-part proof for Problem 4
   - Mathematical proof for Problem 5

2. **Create Assignment5_JFLAP_Files.zip containing:**
   - problem1_cfg.jff
   - problem2_cfg.jff
   - problem3_grammar.jff
   - problem4_ambiguous_grammar.jff
   - problem4_unambiguous_grammar.jff

3. **Prepare both files for submission** to the course management system

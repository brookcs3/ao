## Solutions Summary

### Problem 1 Grammar
```
S → aSbb | aSbbb | λ
```
Generates strings with n a's and m b's where 2n ≤ m ≤ 3n.

### Problem 2 Grammar
```
S → aabS | abaS | baaS | SS | λ
```
Generates strings where number of a's is exactly twice the number of b's.

### Problem 3 Derivation Tree
Complete tree for (a + b) * c + d using the arithmetic expression grammar from Example 5.12.

### Problem 4 Key Results
- Grammar is ambiguous (demonstrated with "aabb")
- Language is NOT inherently ambiguous (constructed S → aSbS | λ as unambiguous equivalent)

### Problem 5 Theorem
Proved: If each variable has at most one production, the grammar is unambiguous.

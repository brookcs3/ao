---

## 3-STEP COMPLETION PROCESS

### STEP 1: Test JFLAP Files (30-45 minutes)

Open JFLAP and test each grammar file with the provided test cases. Take screenshots as you go.

**What you need:**
- JFLAP software (version 7.1 or later)
- The 5 .jff files in this Construct folder
- A screenshot tool

**Detailed Instructions:**
See: **ASSIGNMENT_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** (in this folder) for step-by-step screenshot instructions.

**Key Screenshots Needed:**
1. Problem 1: Grammar + test results
2. Problem 2: Grammar + test results
3. Problem 3: Grammar + test results + derivation tree for `(a+b)*c+d`
4. Problem 4: BOTH grammars + test results + **multiple parse trees for "aabb"**

Save all screenshots in this Construct folder with names like:
- Problem1_JFLAP_Tests.png
- Problem2_JFLAP_Tests.png
- etc.

### STEP 2: Create ZIP File (2 minutes)

1. Select these 5 files in this Construct folder:
   - Problem1_CFG.jff
   - Problem2_CFG.jff
   - Problem3_Expression_Grammar.jff
   - Problem4_Ambiguous_Grammar.jff
   - Problem4_Unambiguous_Grammar.jff

2. Right-click â†’ "Send to" â†’ "Compressed (zipped) folder"
3. Name it: **Assignment5_JFLAP_Files.zip**

This is Part 2 of your submission.

### STEP 3: Create PDF (15-20 minutes)

After taking screenshots, use the interactive-pdf-compiler-midcourse agent to create your PDF.

**Tell the agent:**
"Please compile this walkthrough into a PDF:"
```
C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\WorkingDocs\Assignment_5_Walkthrough.md
```

The agent will:
- Format all your solutions professionally
- Prompt you to add each screenshot in the right place
- Create a complete PDF ready for submission

This is Part 1 of your submission.

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting, verify you have:

**Part 1 (PDF):**
- [ ] All 5 problems with written solutions
- [ ] JFLAP screenshots for Problems 1-4
- [ ] Derivation tree for Problem 3
- [ ] Multiple parse trees screenshot for Problem 4 (proves ambiguity!)
- [ ] All pages numbered
- [ ] Clear, readable formatting

**Part 2 (ZIP):**
- [ ] All 5 .jff files
- [ ] Correctly named: Assignment5_JFLAP_Files.zip

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't skip the screenshots!** They're required by the professor for all grammar problems.

2. **Problem 4 is critical:** The "multiple parse trees" screenshot for "aabb" is the visual proof of ambiguity. Make sure you get this!

3. **Use "Multiple Run" in JFLAP:** This lets you test all strings at once and get them in one screenshot.

4. **Test empty string:** Just leave the input blank when adding test cases in JFLAP.

5. **Save screenshots in Construct folder:** Keep them organized for easy PDF compilation.

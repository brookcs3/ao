This includes:
- Problem 1: CFG construction with full explanation and sample derivations
- Problem 2: CFG construction with full explanation and sample derivations
- Problem 3: Complete derivation tree for (a+b)*c+d with leftmost derivation sequence
- Problem 4: Two-part proof (grammar is ambiguous + language is not inherently ambiguous)
- Problem 5: Formal proof by induction that single-production grammars are unambiguous

### 3. Comprehensive Test Cases Prepared

Detailed test case documentation created in:
**C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\WorkingDocs\JFLAP_Test_Cases.md**

Each JFLAP file has 8-10 test strings (both Accept and Reject cases) ready to use.

## What You Need to Do Next

### STEP 1: Test JFLAP Files and Take Screenshots

You need to open JFLAP and take screenshots for each problem:

#### Problem 1 Screenshots:
1. Open **Problem1_CFG.jff** in JFLAP
2. Go to **Input → Multiple Run**
3. Enter these test strings:
   - **Accept:** (empty string), `abb`, `abbb`, `aabbbb`, `aabbbbb`, `aabbbbbb`, `aaabbbbbbb`
   - **Reject:** `a`, `ab`, `abbbb`, `aab`, `aabb`, `aabbb`, `ba`, `aaabbbb`
4. Click **Run**
5. Take a screenshot showing the grammar window AND the test results
6. Save as: **Problem1_JFLAP_Tests.png** in the Construct folder

#### Problem 2 Screenshots:
1. Open **Problem2_CFG.jff** in JFLAP
2. Go to **Input → Multiple Run**
3. Enter these test strings:
   - **Accept:** (empty string), `aab`, `aba`, `baa`, `aabaab`, `aabbaa`, `baaaab`, `aabaabaab`
   - **Reject:** `a`, `aa`, `b`, `ab`, `aabb`, `aaab`, `abab`, `aaabbb`
4. Click **Run**
5. Take a screenshot showing the grammar window AND the test results
6. Save as: **Problem2_JFLAP_Tests.png** in the Construct folder

#### Problem 3 Screenshots:
1. Open **Problem3_Expression_Grammar.jff** in JFLAP
2. Go to **Input → Multiple Run**
3. Enter these test strings:
   - **Accept:** `a`, `a+b`, `a*b`, `(a+b)*c`, `(a+b)*c+d`, `a+b+c`, `a*b*c`, `(a)`, `a+b*c`
   - **Reject:** `+a`, `a+`, `a++b`, `(a+b`, `a+b)`, `()`, `*`, `e`, `ab`
4. Click **Run**
5. Take a screenshot showing the grammar AND the test results
6. Save as: **Problem3_JFLAP_Tests.png**

7. **BONUS:** Go to **Input → Brute Force Parse**
8. Enter the string: `(a+b)*c+d`
9. Click **Start**
10. Take a screenshot of the derivation tree that appears
11. Save as: **Problem3_Derivation_Tree.png**

#### Problem 4 Screenshots (MOST IMPORTANT):
**For Ambiguous Grammar:**
1. Open **Problem4_Ambiguous_Grammar.jff** in JFLAP
2. Go to **Input → Multiple Run**
3. Enter these test strings:
   - **Accept:** (empty string), `ab`, `aabb`, `aaabbb`, `abab`, `aabbab`, `ababab`, `aaaabbbb`
   - **Reject:** `a`, `b`, `aab`, `abb`, `ba`, `aabbb`, `aaabb`, `abba`
4. Click **Run**
5. Take a screenshot showing the grammar AND the test results
6. Save as: **Problem4_Ambiguous_Tests.png**

7. **CRITICAL:** Go to **Input → Brute Force Parse**
8. Enter the string: `aabb`
9. Click **Start**
10. JFLAP will show **MULTIPLE parse trees** (proving ambiguity!)
11. Take a screenshot showing BOTH parse trees
12. Save as: **Problem4_Ambiguous_ParseTrees.png**

**For Unambiguous Grammar:**
1. Open **Problem4_Unambiguous_Grammar.jff** in JFLAP
2. Go to **Input → Multiple Run**
3. Enter the same test strings as above
4. Click **Run**
5. Take a screenshot showing the grammar AND the test results
6. Save as: **Problem4_Unambiguous_Tests.png**

7. **OPTIONAL:** Use Brute Force Parse on `aabb` again - it will show only ONE parse tree this time!

### STEP 2: Create ZIP File

Once you have all JFLAP files tested, create a ZIP file:

1. Navigate to: **C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\**
2. Select these 5 files:
   - Problem1_CFG.jff
   - Problem2_CFG.jff
   - Problem3_Expression_Grammar.jff
   - Problem4_Ambiguous_Grammar.jff
   - Problem4_Unambiguous_Grammar.jff
3. Right-click → "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
4. Name it: **Assignment5_JFLAP_Files.zip**

### STEP 3: Create PDF with Screenshots

After taking all screenshots, invoke the interactive-pdf-compiler-midcourse agent:

**Command:** Tell the agent to compile the walkthrough with the path:
```
C:\Users\Owner\FALL 2025\INTRO TO THEORY OF COMPUTATION (CS_321_400_F2025)\Modue 5\Construct\WorkingDocs\Assignment_5_Walkthrough.md
```

The agent will:
- Create a professionally formatted PDF
- Include all written solutions
- Prompt you to add the screenshots you took in the appropriate sections
- Include all CFG productions, derivation trees, and proofs

## Important Notes

1. **Empty String Testing:** When testing the empty string in JFLAP, just leave the input field blank and add it to the test list.

2. **Problem 4 is Key:** The ambiguity proof relies heavily on showing multiple parse trees for "aabb". Make sure the screenshot clearly shows both trees side-by-side.

3. **JFLAP Multiple Run:** Always use "Input → Multiple Run" to test multiple strings at once. This allows you to get all test results in one screenshot as required by the assignment.

4. **Grammar Visibility:** When taking screenshots, make sure the grammar productions are visible in the same window as the test results.

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the JFLAP_Test_Cases.md file for detailed testing instructions
- Verify that all .jff files open correctly in JFLAP
- Ensure you're using JFLAP 7.1 or later
- Make sure to use "Multiple Run" feature for testing (not "Step" or "Fast Run")

---

## Ready to Proceed!

You now have everything you need to complete Assignment 5:
1. All JFLAP files are created and ready to test
2. All written solutions are complete
3. Test cases are documented
4. Next steps are clearly outlined

Good luck with your submission!

Assignment 5 
Due Wednesday by 11:59pm Points 60 Submitting a file upload Available until Oct 31 at 11:59pm


JFLAP files and test case screenshots
For each automaton (such as a DFA or NFA), submit a JFLAP file (.jff file) of the automaton and a screenshot of some test cases for it, test cases should include strings in the language (Accept) and strings not in the language (Reject). Use Input/Multiple Run for this, so you can get all the tests in one screenshot. The screenshot must also include the automaton.

All your solutions should be submitted as two separate attachments in the below format:

A single PDF file with all of the written explanation answers. If any questions ask you to provide an automaton (such as a DFA), the test case screenshots should be included in your PDF file.
A single ZIP file of all the JFLAP files (.jff files) in the assignment (do not submit a rar file). If you don't need to provide an automaton for any questions in the assignment, then you don't need to submit a ZIP file.


# Problems

## Section 5.1
1. Create a context-free grammar for the language L = {a^n b^m : 2n <= m <= 3n}.
2. Create a context-free grammar for the language L = {w in {a, b}* : n_a(w) = 2n_b(w)}.

## Section 5.2
3. Give the derivation tree for (a + b) * c + d, using the grammar in Example 5.12, but with I -> a|b|c|d.
4. Show that the following grammar is ambiguous, but that the language it generates is not inherently ambiguous.
   S -> aSb|SS|(empty)
5. Prove that if G is a context-free grammar in which no variable occurs on the left side of more than one production, then G is unambiguous.

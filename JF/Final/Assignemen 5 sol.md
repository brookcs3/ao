Section 5.1: Context-Free Grammar Construction

Problem 1: Create a context-free grammar for the language $L = \{a^n b^m \mid 2n \le m \le 3n\}$

1. Context-Free Grammar (CFG):
The grammar is designed to ensure that for every $a$ generated, the number of $b$'s is between 2 and 3.

$$S \rightarrow aSbb \mid aSbbb \mid \lambda$$

2. Correctness Analysis:
The grammar correctly enforces the range $2n \le m \le 3n$. Every application of $S \rightarrow a\dots S$ increments $n$ by 1 and adds either $2b$'s (for the minimum case, $2n$) or $3b$'s (for the maximum case, $3n$). Any combination of these rules generates $m$ such that $2n \le m \le 3n$.

Problem 2: Create a context-free grammar for the language $L = \{w \in \{a, b\}^* \mid n_a(w) = 2 \cdot n_b(w)\}$

1. Context-Free Grammar (CFG):
This grammar ensures a constant ratio of $2 a$'s for every $1 b$ added, regardless of the order in which the terminals are interleaved.

$$S \rightarrow aabS \mid abaS \mid baaS \mid \lambda$$

2. Correctness Analysis:
This grammar is correct. Since $L$ requires $n_a(w) = 2 \cdot n_b(w)$, every string must be a concatenation of blocks, where each block contains two $a$'s and one $b$. The three recursive rules ($aabS$, $abaS$, $baaS$) account for all three possible $2a/1b$ terminal arrangements, maintaining the $2:1$ ratio and allowing for arbitrary interleaving.

Section 5.2: Derivations and Ambiguity

Problem 3: Give the derivation tree for $(a + b) * c + d$, using the grammar in Example 5.12, but with $I \rightarrow a \mid b \mid c \mid d$.

1. Grammar Rules (Modified Example 5.12):

$E \rightarrow E+T \mid T$ (Low Precedence: Addition)

$T \rightarrow T*F \mid F$ (Medium Precedence: Multiplication)

$F \rightarrow (E) \mid I$ (High Precedence: Parentheses)

$I \rightarrow a \mid b \mid c \mid d$

2. Derivation Tree (Screenshot from JFLAP):
The parse tree correctly enforces precedence. The outermost operator is addition ($+$), which is the first non-terminal expanded at the root $E$.

3. Leftmost Derivation Sequence:
The derivation sequence that yields the tree above is:

$$\begin{align*}
E &\xrightarrow{} E+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} T+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} T*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} F*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (E)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (E+T)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (T+T)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (F+T)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (I+T)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+T)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+F)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+I)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*F+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*I+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*c+T \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*c+F \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*c+I \\
&\xrightarrow{} (a+b)*c+d
\end{align*}$$

Problem 4: Show that the following grammar is ambiguous, but that the language it generates is not inherently ambiguous.

1. Ambiguous Grammar ($G_A$):
The grammar to be tested for ambiguity is:

$$G_A: S \rightarrow aSb \mid SS \mid \lambda$$

2. Part I: Showing $G_A$ is Ambiguous
The grammar $G_A$ is ambiguous because the string $w = aabb$ can be derived via two distinct parse trees:

Feature

Tree 1 (aSb First)

Tree 2 (SS First)

Initial Rule

$S \rightarrow aSb$ (Nested $a(ab)b$)

$S \rightarrow SS$ (Concatenated $(ab)(ab)$)

Tree Structure

Root $S$ has 3 children: $a, S, b$

Root $S$ has 2 children: $S, S$

JFLAP Tree





The existence of two distinct trees for the same string $aabb$ proves that the grammar $G_A$ is ambiguous.

3. Part II: Showing the Language $L(G_A)$ is Not Inherently Ambiguous
The language generated by $G_A$ is $L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \ge 0\}$. A language is not inherently ambiguous if an unambiguous grammar can be found to generate it.

Unambiguous Grammar ($G_U$):

$$G_U: S \rightarrow aSb \mid \lambda$$

Proof: The grammar $G_U$ generates $L(G_A)$ and is unambiguous because every string $a^n b^n$ can only be generated in one way: applying $S \rightarrow aSb$ exactly $n$ times, followed by the single $\lambda$ rule. Since an unambiguous grammar ($G_U$) exists for the language, $L(G_A)$ is not inherently ambiguous.

Problem 5: Prove that if G is a context-free grammar in which no variable occurs on the left side of more than one production, then G is unambiguous.

Formal Write-up for Assignment

Theorem: Let $G = (V, T, S, P)$ be a context-free grammar such that each variable $A \in V$ appears on the left-hand side of at most one production in $P$. Then $G$ is unambiguous.

Proof:

We prove this directly by showing that every string $w \in L(G)$ has a unique derivation tree.

We proceed by strong induction on the number of derivation steps required to generate $w$.

Base Case ($n = 1$):
If $w$ is derived in one step, the derivation is $S \rightarrow w$. Since $S$ has at most one production in $P$, this derivation (and its resulting tree) is uniquely determined.

Inductive Step (Hypothesis):
Assume that for all strings derivable in $k$ or fewer steps ($k \ge 1$), the derivation tree is unique.

Inductive Step (Conclusion):
Consider a string $w$ derived in $k + 1$ steps. The derivation must begin with the first production:

$$S \xrightarrow{} \alpha$$

where $\alpha = \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \dots \alpha_m$. Since the variable $S$ appears on the left side of at most one production, this initial step $S \rightarrow \alpha$ is uniquely determined.

The final string $w$ is partitioned as $w = w_1 w_2 \dots w_m$. For any $\alpha_i \in V$ (a variable), $w_i$ is derived from $\alpha_i$ in fewer than $k+1$ steps. Since each variable $\alpha_i$ has at most one production, the derivation tree for $w_i$ from $\alpha_i$ is unique by the inductive hypothesis.

Since:

The first step ($S \rightarrow \alpha$) is unique.

Every subsequent subtree derived from $\alpha_i$ is unique.

The entire derivation tree for $w$ is uniquely determined.

By the principle of mathematical induction, every string in $L(G)$ has a unique derivation tree.

Therefore, the grammar $\mathbf{G}$ is unambiguous. $\mathbf{\square}$

## 📊 Required Agents for This Module

### Primary Agent: `interactive-pdf-compiler`
- **Purpose:** Compile LaTeX document with embedded screenshots
- **Status:** READY TO USE
- **Input:** Solution markdown + screenshots + LaTeX template
- **Output:** Assignment_5_Submission.pdf

### Secondary Agent: `jflap-automata-builder`
- **Purpose:** Create/validate JFLAP files
- **Status:** ALREADY COMPLETED (files vetted by user)

### Tertiary Agent: `module-setup-validator`
- **Purpose:** Validate folder structure and navigation
- **Status:** CURRENTLY RUNNING (this report)

---

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Identified

### 1. Filename Typo
- **File:** `Assignemen 5 sol.md` (should be "Assignment")
- **Impact:** LOW (content is correct, just cosmetic)
- **Action:** Can be renamed if desired, but not critical for submission

### 2. Duplicate Solution Files
- **Location:** Both `JF/Final/Assignemen 5 sol.md` and `JF/Assignemen 5 sol.md` exist
- **Impact:** LOW (both contain same content)
- **Action:** No action needed, just be aware of duplication

---

## ❌ No Critical Issues Found

All required components are present and properly organized. No blocking issues detected.

## 🆕 New Agent Assessment

**Question:** Does this assignment require any NEW agent types not currently available?

**Answer:** NO

**Reasoning:**
- Assignment requires JFLAP files → `jflap-automata-builder` (already used)
- Assignment requires PDF with screenshots → `interactive-pdf-compiler` (available)
- Assignment requires formal proofs → Standard LaTeX formatting (covered by pdf-compiler)
- No programming, no external tools, no novel requirements

**Existing agents are sufficient for this module.**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Validation Complete** - This report confirms all materials are ready
2. ⏭️ **Proceed to PDF Compilation** - Use `interactive-pdf-compiler` agent
3. ⏭️ **Create ZIP Archive** - Package all 6 JFLAP files for submission

### PDF Compilation Checklist:
- [ ] Copy LaTeX template to working directory
- [ ] Copy all 9 screenshots to `images/` folder
- [ ] Convert solution markdown to LaTeX format
- [ ] Compile PDF with `pdflatex`
- [ ] Verify all images are embedded correctly
- [ ] Check page formatting and math notation

### ZIP Archive Checklist:
- [ ] Collect all 6 .jff files:
  - Problem 1.jff
  - Problem 2.jff
  - P3.jff
  - Ambiguous Grammar Tree 1 (aSb First).jff
  - Ambiguous Grammar Tree 2 (SS First).jff
  - Unambiguous Grammar.jff
- [ ] Create `Assignment_5_JFLAP_Files.zip`
- [ ] Verify ZIP contains exactly 6 files

### Final Submission:
- [ ] `Assignment_5_Submission.pdf` (compiled from LaTeX)
- [ ] `Assignment_5_JFLAP_Files.zip` (6 .jff files)
- [ ] Submit both files to Canvas before deadline (Oct 31, 11:59 PM)
